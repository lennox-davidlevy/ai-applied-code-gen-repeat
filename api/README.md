# Server

Based on David Sheng and Drew McCalmont's fast api for the JPMC Oslo project, needs rework to fit in with this though.

Very cool structure that can be scaled well, and potentially use persistent storage for x.ai params and prompt templates.

## How to run
```
uvicorn server:app --reload
```
